# **Apit212**

It has been a few years since i created the first Python based API for the trading212 platform and it worked well at the time. unfortunatly they made some major updates since which rendered the old Apit212 useless :( 

But i'm back this time im using playwright. I was hoping Trading 212 would have allowed CFD trades to be executed using the official API but still nothing.

please note that either myself or trading212 take responsibility for the outcomes related to the uses of this API.

## Requirements
* Playwright
* playwright_stealth
* getpass
* typing
* Requests
* Python3
* PyQt6
* textual

## Installation

pip install apit212

# Import

to start using this API you will first need to login to the account using **apit212** you will then be able to use all the functions and create your own trading bot or use it to scarpe data from the trading212 platform.
